== Overview ==

This shows you how to install a copy of the pentadactyl-related files that I
use. It's probably not too terribly useful if you're not me, but who knows?

Please note that these instructions or *NOT* complete. They are still a
work-in-progress while I learn the basics of git.

== Linux/Mac ==

Plugin

        Of course, you first need to install the Pentadactyl plugin for Firefox

Download files

        git clone git://github.com/tompurl/dotpentadactyl.git ~/.pentadactyl

Create Symlinks

        $ cd ~ 
        $ ln -s ~/.pentadactyl/pentadactylrc ~/.pentadactylrc
